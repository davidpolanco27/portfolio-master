      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>  Hi, my name's David Polanco. Iâ€™m 26-year-old born in The Dominican Republic,  I came to New York City in 2012 to pursue  the American dream
                  and to have a better life.  I lived in the Bronx ever since. I am transfer student from Laguardia Community College. I am interested in studying Computer Science because I find it fascinating. When I was a child,
                   I was absolutely attracted by computer games and later it was programming. I also like studying maths and physics, but I chose computing as my career because of its opening, modernity and lots of challenges. The world of computers is 
                   growing at an un-recordable rate everyday.  Computers are the most influential tools in our lives, they are our present and future.
